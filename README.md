A web app built with Django, DRF and Celery. The app uses Celery to periodically run the process of aggregation and parsing of XMLs from RSS feeds. The results are saved to database as separate entries. The entries are displayed together in a single view based on user subscriptions. User can subscribe to the any available feeds and bookmark news entries. Bookmarks are serialized and displayed in a read-only endpoint.
